# | Spring Boot Sports Organizer Project |
# |      Created by Dallas Schauer       |
# ========================================

This project acts as a full-stack web site acting as a sports organization tool, meaning
a web site that emulates the real life applications used by many recreational centers to
organize local sporting events. This app lets users create accounts, organize and join 
different sporting events divided into leagues and tournaments, and create and join teams.
The program takes care of scheduling, maintaining rules, and providing a convenient
user interface.

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS
